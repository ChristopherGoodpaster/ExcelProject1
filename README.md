# ExcelProject1
Program is to create a button for Stream Deck to add a number to an excel file on the current day of the week. The number will increase every time you click the button on the Stream Deck. The purpose of this would be to add the amount of wins in a videogame you have for that day, or how many times your dog has gone outside to poop for that day.
